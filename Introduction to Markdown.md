**Hello** _world_.

This is **_markdown_**.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://www.google.com) to find things.

# Table in Markdown
## This is a Level two header

Name       | Age       | SupePower         | Coolness

To make a list we can use the following:

* This is item one
* This is item two
    * This is a subpoint in the list
        * This is also another subpoint

- This is another list
- We can use dashes instead of *s

1. This is item one
2. This is item two
    - This is a **subpoint** under two
3. This is _item_ three

# Blockquote

These are usually use to show quote, things that someone has said

It's useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines
